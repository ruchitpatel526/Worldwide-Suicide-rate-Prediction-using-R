# Worldwide-Suicide-rate-Prediction-using-R

This project uncovers essential features responsible for varying suicide rates in different countries, such as economic level, health services, and unemployment rates. Also, the project proves the correlations.


The kinds of analysis done in this project will enable decision makers to generate a holistic understanding of the trend of suicides across many dimensions and possibly take measures to combat it.

Every year, close to 800,000 people succumb to their worsening mental health and choose suicide as a rescue. Ironically, despite such alarming figures, most countries still do not have a national strategy in place to prevent suicides. This is a whole new catastrophe in itself as the facts state that “for every one person who dies due to suicide, 20 or more people are attempting it”.

In a world, where technology peeps its face in every second aspect of human lives, it would be a shame if the very same technology did not deliver a way to bring an insight indicating potential victims of suicide.

Thus, keeping in mind the above facts, the main idea of this project is to create a model to analyze the trends between several variables. Using the variables like Country, Year, Sex, Age, Suicide number, Population, Suicide per 100k population, GDP for year ($), GDP per capita ($), Generation and more we can predict how GDP is correlated with suicide rates, in which generation are the maximum suicides observed, etc.
